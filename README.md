# Tutorial: LSST sims 2025

LSST light-curve simulations based on ELASTICC models and Obsv4.3 (before Ocean for DDF).

Simulations done with [SNANA](https://github.com/RickKessler/SNANA) and/or [PIPPIN](https://github.com/dessn/Pippin).

This sims include both Wide Fast Deep (WFD)and Deep Drilling Fields (DDF).

They are a subset of Year 1 simulations (not realistic rates).
